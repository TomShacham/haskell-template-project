# haskell-template-project

This is a simple haskell project template because it's so fucking annoying to set up

I'm using the haskell 7.10.2 ghc version, which if you download the zip of, comes with stack and cabal and you don't have to pull your hair out and dance around in a circle to get something to compile

Loljk love you haskelllllll

#important

The name of this project is cps, so replace it with whatever name you want, and the respective files in the .cabal file which tells cabal how to do its fucking job ;) cool
